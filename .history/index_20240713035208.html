          Hi there! ðŸ‘‹<br>
          My name is Salah EL-Din <br> I'm a <span>Back End Web Developer.</span>
          I'm a fresh graduate from the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Faculty. My main interest lies in back-end development using PHP and the Laravel framework. I also hold a certificate from the Information Technology Institute (ITI) in Back-end development using PHP and Laravel. I'm eager to gain practical experience in this field.
          To improve my skills, I actively participated in and presented at student activities.
          In October 2022, I joined to MSP Tech Club - Al Azhar and was accepted into the Back-End track, specializing in PHP and Laravel. I participated with them in the Back-end Development - Tri Era - MSP'23 as an instructor for the first session. In this session, I covered an introduction to front-end and back-end development as well as web hosting. Additionally, I explained some basics of PHP programming, such as (variables, data types, operators, arrays, strings, and conditions).
          In the following season, specifically in November 2023, I expanded my horizons by joining the MSP Flutter Committee. This new venture immersed me in the world of mobile applications, where I gained some information and experience about Dart and the Flutter framework. Concurrently, in December 2023, I became a member of the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC), further strengthening my front-end skills. With GDSC, I learned invaluable tricks and insights that have significantly enhanced my technical repertoire.
          Currently, I am looking for a job for 6 months before I apply for military service in January.
